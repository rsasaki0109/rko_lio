 * Process raw timestamps and calculates absolute timestamps in seconds.
 *
 * The input timestamps can be either absolute or relative and may be in seconds or nanoseconds.
 * The function automatically detects whether the timestamps are in nanoseconds by checking the
 * duration spread and converts them to seconds accordingly.
 * Then the case of absolute or relative time is disambiguated based on how close (or away) the min or max times are to
 * the header time.
 *
 * Alternatively you can specify `force_absolute` or `force_relative` in the config to skip the checks for automatic
 * conversion.
 *
 * @param raw_timestamps Vector of raw sensor timestamps as doubles, can be relative or absolute values.
 * @param header_stamp Reference absolute timestamp corresponding to the scan's header time.
 * @param config timestamp specific config to use in processing.
 * @return A struct containing:
 *   - The computed scan start time (absolute, Secondsd),
 *   - The computed scan end time (absolute, Secondsd),
 *   - A vector of all processed point timestamps converted to absolute seconds (TimestampVector).
 * @throws std::runtime_error If the timestamp format or values are unrecognized or unsupported.
